# Knight's Tour Problem

The famous knight’s tour problem asks whether a knight can tour an entire 8 × 8 chessboard visiting each square exactly once. 
A knight can move in any of 8 ways, provided that the final destination is within the board. 
In each of these ways, one coordinate of the knight’s position changes by 2 units (positively or negatively), and the other coordinate changes by 1 unit (positively or negatively). 
If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed, otherwise it is open.

This project demonstrates a recursive & iterative code, with or without multithreading, using JavaFX animation.
